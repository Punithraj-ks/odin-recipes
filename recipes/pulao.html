      <h4>Instructions:</h4>
         <ol>
          <p><li> <strong>Rinse the rice:</strong>
          Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Prep Vegetables:</strong> 
          Chop the mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces. You can use a combination of carrots, peas, beans, corn, or any other vegetables of your choice.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Sauté the whole spices:</strong>
          Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker.
          Add cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaf. Sauté until the spices release their aroma.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Add onions and cashews:</strong>
          Add thinly sliced onions and cashews (if using). Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Add ginger-garlic paste:</strong>
          Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Add tomatoes and spices:</strong>
          Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.
          Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Add vegetables:</strong>
          Add the chopped vegetables and sauté for a few minutes.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Drain and add rice:</strong>
          Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pan. Mix gently to coat the rice with the spices.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Add water and salt:</strong>
          Pour in 2 cups of water and add salt according to your taste. Stir well.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Cook the pulao:</strong>
          If using a pressure cooker, close the lid without the weight and cook on medium heat for one whistle. If using a pan, cover it with a tight-fitting lid and simmer on low heat until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed (about 15-20 minutes).</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Fluff the rice:</strong>
          Once the rice is cooked, let it sit for a few minutes. Then, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.</li></p>
         <p><li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong>
          Garnish the vegetable pulao with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with raita or yogurt.</li></p>
